Let's make Terraria in C++!  
I decided to make a "simple" clone of Terraria in C++ using my own engine which is being created on the go.

I decided to create this game/engine in order to improve my programming skills in C++ and see, 
how "easy" it is to recreate such a popular 2D pixelart-ish game in C++ with only a "few" 3rd party libraries. 
Well, if there is a hell in the world... I think I've found it.
Also this project focuses on Terraria clone as well as on "universal" 3D engine, 
so updates in [TIMELINE.md](screenshots/TIMELINE.md) are from both.
And yes, I like to use '"' a lot.
