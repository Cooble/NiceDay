Let's make Terraria in C++!  
I decided to make a "simple" clone of Terraria in C++ using my own engine which is being created on the go.

##### Other stuff
I decided to create this game in order to improve my programming skills in C++ and see, how "easy" it is to recreate such a popular 2D pixelart-ish game in C++ with "nearly" no 3rd party libraries. Well, if there is a hell in the world... I think I've found it.

##### 3rd party libs
- The engine is inspired by: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel   
- IMGUI https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
- GLFW https://github.com/glfw/glfw
- GLM https://github.com/g-truc/glm
- GLAD https://glad.dav1d.de/
- SPDLOG https://github.com/gabime/spdlog
- STB https://github.com/nothings/stb
