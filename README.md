Let's make Terraria in C++!  
I decided to make a "simple" clone of Terraria in C++ using my own engine which is being created on the go.

I decided to create this game/engine in order to improve my programming skills in C++ and see, 
how "easy" it is to recreate such a popular 2D pixelart-ish game in C++ with "nearly" no 3rd party libraries. 
Well, if there is a hell in the world... I think I've found it.
